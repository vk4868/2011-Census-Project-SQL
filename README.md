# 2011 Census Analysis
## Problem
  We have a dataset about the 2011 Indian Census. We are required to carry out a analysis of the data to implement any improvements in the states.
## Plan
- Understand the fields given in each dataset and the relation between both the datasets.
- Find the average growth, sex ration and literacy rate from the datasets.
- Calculate the number of males and females from the sex ratio and population of the state.
- Use multiple subqueries to calculate the previous census population using the growth percentage.
- Prepare a population vs area comparison table between this census and the previous census population.
